# WinForms
- LawnMowerSim: A WinForms simulation of a robotic lawnmower that has to cut all the grass(darkgreen -> lightgreen) in an obstacle(black) filled garden. (There are 4 algorithms implemented right now in it, LineFill2 algorithm provides the best results so far but still lacks some functionality that is yet to be created.)
